        <h1>What is Cardiac Arrest?</h1>
        <p> Cardiac arrest is a serious heart condition. The word arrest means to stop or bring to a halt.<br> 
            In cardiac arrest, the heart ceases to beat. It’s also known as sudden cardiac death.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="course-col">
                    <h2>What Causes Cardiac Arrest?</h2>
                    <p> A number of factors can cause sudden cardiac arrest. Two of the most common are ventricular and atrial fibrillation.</p>
             <h3>Ventricular Fibrillation</h3>
             <p>Your heart has four chambers. The two lower chambers are the ventricles. In ventricular fibrillation, these chambers quiver out of control. This causes the heart’s rhythm to change dramatically. The ventricles begin to pump inefficiently, which severely decreases the amount of blood pumped through the body. In some cases, the circulation of blood stops completely. This may lead to sudden cardiac death.
                The most frequent cause of cardiac arrest is ventricular fibrillation.
                </p>
                <h3>Atrial Fibrillation</h3>
                <p>The heart can also stop beating efficiently after an arrhythmia in the upper chambers. These chambers are known as the atria.
                    Atrial fibrillation begins when the sinoatrial (SA) node doesn’t send out the correct electrical impulses. Your SA node is located in the right atrium. It regulates how quickly the heart pumps blood. When the electrical impulse goes into atrial fibrillation, the ventricles can’t pump blood out to the body efficiently.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="course-col">
                    <h2>Who Is at Risk for Cardiac Arrest?</h2>
                    <p> Certain heart conditions and health factors can increase your risk of cardiac arrest.</p>

      <h3>Coronary Heart Disease</h3>
             <p>This type of heart disease begins in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply the heart muscle itself. When they become blocked, your heart does not receive blood. It may stop working properly.
                </p>

         <h3>Large Heart</h3>
                <p>Having an abnormally large heart places you at increased risk for cardiac arrest. A large heart may not beat correctly. The muscle may also be more prone to damage.
                    </p>

        <h3>Irregular Heart Valves</h3>
            <p>Valve disease can make heart valves leaky or narrower. This means blood circulating through the heart either overloads the chambers with blood or does not fill them to capacity. The chambers may become weakened or enlarged
                        </p>
                        
         <h3>Congenital Heart Disease</h3>
                        <p>Some people are born with heart damage. This is known as a congenital heart problem. Sudden cardiac arrest may occur in children who were born with a serious heart problem.
                            </p> 
        <h3>Electrical Impulse Problems</h3>
                         <p>Problems with your heart’s electrical system can increase your risk of sudden cardiac death. These problems are known as primary heart rhythm abnormalities.
                                </p>
            <p>Other risk factors for cardiac arrest include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>smoking</li><li>sedentary lifestyle</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li><li>obesity</li>
<li>family history of heart disease</li><li>history of a previous heart attack</li>
<li>age over 45 for men, or over 55 for women</li><li>male gender</li><li>substance abuse</li><li>low potassium or magnesium</li>
</ul>
 </div>
 <div class="course-col">
     <h2>Recognizing the Signs and Symptoms of Cardiac Arrest</h2>
     <p>Early symptoms of cardiac arrest are often warning signs. Getting treatment before your heart stops could save your life.<br><br>If you are in cardiac arrest, you may:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>become dizzy</li><li>be short of breath</li><li>feel fatigued or weak</li><li>vomit</li><li>experience heart palpitations</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Immediate emergency care is needed if you or someone you are with experiences these symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>chest pain</li><li>no pulse</li><li>not breathing or difficulty breathing</li><li>loss of consciousness</li><li>collapse</li>

    <h2>Types of heart disease</h2>
    <p>Heart disease refers to any condition affecting the cardiovascular system. There are several different types of heart disease, and they affect the heart and blood vessels in different ways.

       <br><br> The sections below look at some different types of heart disease in more detail.</p>
     <ul>
         
<Li>  <h3>Coronary artery disease</h3>
       <p>Coronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common type of heart disease.<br>
        It develops when the arteries that supply blood to the heart become clogged with plaque. This causes them to harden and narrow. Plaque contains cholesterol and other substances.
      <br>As a result, the blood supply reduces, and the heart receives less oxygen and fewer nutrients. In time, the heart muscle weakens, and there is a risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.
        <br>When plaque builds up in the arteries, it is called atherosclerosis. Plaque in the arteries can rupture from blockages and cause blood flow to stop, which can lead to a heart attack.
        </p>
</Li>
<li> <h3>Congenital heart defects</h3>
    <p>A person with a congenital heart defect is born with a heart problem. There are many types of congenital heart defects, includingTrusted Source:
    </p>  <ul>
            <li><b>Atypical heart valves:</b> Valves may not open properly, or they may leak blood.</li>
    <li><b>Septal defects:</b> There is a hole in the wall between either the lower chambers or the upper chambers of the heart. </li>
    <li><b>Atresia:</b> One of the heart valves is missing. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Congenital heart disease can involve major structural issues, such as the absence of a ventricle or problems with unusual connections between the main arteries that leave the heart.<br>
        Many congenital heart defects do not cause any noticeable symptoms and only become apparent during a routine medical check.<br>
        According to the American Heart Association (AHA)Trusted Source, heart murmurs often affect children, but only some are due to a defect.</p>
</li>
<li>  <h3>Arrhythmia</h3>
    <p>Arrhythmia refers to an irregular heartbeatTrusted Source. It occurs when the electrical impulses that coordinate the heartbeat do not work correctly. As a result, the heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or erratically.
    <br>There are various types of arrhythmias, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Tachycardia:</b> This refers to a rapid heartbeat.</li>
    <li> <b>Bradycardia:</b> This refers to a slow heartbeat. </li>
    <li><b>Premature contractions:</b> This refers to an early heartbeat. </li>
    <li><b>Atrial fibrillation:</b> This is a type of irregular heartbeat. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A person may notice a feeling like a fluttering or a racing heart.<br>
    In some cases, arrhythmias can be life threatening or have severe complications.</p>
    </li>
<li><h3>Dilated cardiomyopathy</h3>
    <p>In dilated cardiomyopathy, the heart chambers become dilated, meaning that the heart muscle stretches and becomes thinner. The most common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy are past heart attacks, arrhythmias, and toxins, but genetics can also play a role.<br>
        As a result, the heart becomes weaker and cannot pump blood properly. It can result in arrhythmia, blood clots in the heart, and heart failure.<br>
        It usually affects people aged 20–60 yearsTrusted Source, according to the AHA.
        </p>
</li>
<li> <h3>Myocardial infarction</h3>
        <p>Also known as heart attack, myocardial infarction involves an interruption of the blood flow to the heart. This can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle.
            <br>The most common cause of heart attack is plaque, a blood clot, or both in a coronary artery. It can also occur if an artery suddenly narrows or spasms.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Heart failure</h3>
        <p> When a person has heart failure, their heart is still workingTrusted Source but not as well as it should be. Congestive heart failure is a type of heart failure that can occur from problems with the pumping or relaxing function.
            <br>Heart failure can result from untreated coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and other conditions. These conditions can affect the heart’s ability to pump or relax properly.
            <br>Heart failure can be life threatening, but seeking early treatment for heart-related conditions can help prevent complications.</p>
        </li>
<Li><h3>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</h3>
    <p>
    This condition usually develops when a genetic problem affects the heart muscle. It tends to be an inherited condition.
    <br>The walls of the muscle thicken, and contractions become harder. This affects the heart’s ability to take in and pump out blood. In some cases, an obstruction can occur.
    <br>There may be no symptoms, and many people do not receive a diagnosis. However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can worsen over time and lead to various heart problems.
    <br>Anyone with a family history of this condition should ask for screening, as receiving treatment can help prevent complications.
    Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the main cause of cardiac deathTrusted Source among young people and athletes under 35 years old, according to the AHA.
    </p>
</Li>
<li><h3>Mitral valve regurgitation</h3>
    <p>This event occurs whenTrusted Source the mitral valve in the heart does not close tightly enough and allows blood to flow back into the heart.
    <br>As a result, blood cannot move through the heart or body efficiently, and it can put pressure on the chambers of the heart. In time, the heart can become enlarged, and heart failure can result.
    </p>
   </li>
<li> <h3>Mitral valve prolapse </h3>
    <p> This happens when the valve flaps of the mitral valve do not close properly. Instead, they bulge into the left atrium. This can cause a heart murmur.
       <br>Mitral valve prolapse is not usually life threatening, but some people may need to receive treatment for it.
        <br>Genetic factors and connective tissue problems can cause this condition, which affects around 2%Trusted Source of the population.
        </p>
        <li><h3>Aortic stenosis</h3>
        <p>In aortic stenosisTrusted Source, the pulmonary valve is thick or fused and does not open correctly. This makes it hard for the heart to pump blood from the left ventricle into the aortaTrusted Source.
            <br>A person may be born with it due to congenital anomalies of the valve, or it may develop over time due to calcium deposits or scarring
             </p>
