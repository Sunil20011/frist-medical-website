        <h1>Types of tests</h1>
        <P>Routine heart health screenings are an important part of preventive healthcare 
            for adults.</P><p>Starting around age 20, or in some cases earlier, your doctor will likely advise 
            you to get several screening tests on a regular basis.</p><p>Starting around age 20, or in some cases earlier, your doctor will likely advise 
            you to get several screening tests on a regular basis.</p><p>Family history can determine when the testing should start and how frequently 
            it should be done.</P>

        <h2>Routine screening tests</h2>
        <p>Even if you have no history of heart disease, the AHATrusted 
            Source recommends getting the following heart health screenings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>blood pressure and cholesterol tests</b>, starting by age 20 for most people</p></li>
                <li><p><b>blood glucose tests,</b>starting by age 40 to 45 for most people</p></li>
                <li><p><b>body mass index (BMI) measurement</b>, based on body weight or waist 
                    circumference</p></li>

            </ul>
            <p>If you have certain risk factors for heart disease or a strong family history, 
                your doctor might encourage you to start these screenings at a younger age 
                than usual.
                </p>
    <p>They may also order high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) testing. This 
        test measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation or infection 
        that’s associated with increased risk of heart attack.</p>

        <h2>Additional heart tests</h2>
        <p>If your doctor thinks you might have heart disease, they may order one of 
            more of the following tests to assess your heart health:
            </p>
     <ul>
        <li><p><b>Electrocardiography (ECG, EKG).</b>Small, sticky electrodes are applied 
            to your chest and attached to a special machine, known an ECG 
            machine. This machine records your heart’s electrical activity and 
            provides information about your heart rate and rhythm.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Exercise cardiac stress test.</b>Electrodes are applied to your chest and 
                attached to an ECG machine. Then you’re asked to walk or run on a 
                treadmill, or pedal on a stationary bike, while a healthcare professional 
                assesses your heart’s response to physical stress.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Echocardiography.</b>A healthcare professional uses an ultrasound 
            machine to create moving images of your heart to see if you have 
            problems with the pumping function of your heart, and to assess your 
            heart valves. Sometimes, they may do this before and after you’ve 
            exercised or taken certain medications to learn how your heart responds 
            to stress.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Nuclear stress test.</b>A small amount of radioactive dye is injected into 
            your bloodstream, where it travels to your heart. A healthcare 
            professional uses an imaging machine to take pictures while you’re at 
            rest and after exercise to learn how blood is flowing through your heart.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cardiac CT scan for calcium scoring.</b>You’re positioned under a CT 
            scanner with electrodes attached to your chest to record your heart’s 
            electrical activity. A healthcare professional uses the CT scanner to 
            create images of your heart and check for plaque buildup in your 
            coronary arteries.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Coronary CT angiography (CTA).</b>Similar to the test above, you lie 
            under a CT scanner with electrodes attached to your chest so a 
            healthcare professional can record your heart’s activity and create 
            pictures of your heart based on the CT scan’s images. A contrast dye is 
            injected into your bloodstream to make it easier for them to see plaque 
            buildup in your coronary arteries.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Coronary catheter angiography.</b>A small tube, or catheter, is inserted 
            into your groin or arm and threaded through an artery to your heart. 
            Contrast dye is injected through the catheter while a healthcare 
            professional takes X-ray pictures of your heart, allowing them to see if 
            your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you receive a diagnosis of heart disease, your doctor may recommend a 
            combination of lifestyle changes, medications, or other treatments to manage 
            it.</p>
        
        <h2>List of heart checkup tests and 
            screening questions</h2>
        <p>A routine heart health checkup doesn’t typically involve complicated tests. To 
            monitor the health of your heart, your doctor should routinely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>assess your weight and BMI</p></li>
                <li><p>measure your blood pressure</p></li>
                <li><p>order blood tests to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels</p></li>
                <li><p>ask about your diet, physical activity, and smoking history</p></li>
                <li><p>ask about your personal and family medical history</p></li>
                <li><p>ask whether you’ve noticed any changes in your health</p></li>
               
            </ul>
        <p>If you’ve received a heart disease diagnosis or your healthcare provider thinks 
            you might have developed it, they may order other heart tests.</p>

        <h2><b>When should you get a heart 
            checkup?</b></h2>
        <p>The AHATrusted Source recommends the following schedule for heart health 
            screenings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><b>Weight and BMI: </b>Weight and BMI: </p></li>
            <li><p><b>Blood pressure tests:</b>Blood pressure tests:</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Blood cholesterol tests:</b>at least once every 4 to 6 years, starting by age 20</p></li>
            <li><p><b>Blood glucose tests:</b>at least once every 3 years, typically starting at age 40 to 45</p></li>

        </ul>
        <p>Some people should get heart health screenings at a younger age or more 
            often than others</p>
            <p>For example, your doctor may recommend earlier or more frequent screening 
                if you have:</p>
     <ul>
         <li><p>high blood pressure, blood cholesterol, or blood sugar</p></li>
         <li><p>a heart condition, such as atrial fibrillation</p></li>
         <li><p>a family history of heart disease
        </p></li>
         <li><p>overweight or obesity</p></li>
         <li><p>prediabetes or diabetes</p></li>
         <li><p>prediabetes or diabetes</p></li>
         <li><p>had complications during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes</p></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Ask your doctor how often you should undergo heart health screenings, based 
        on your medical history and health needs.</p>
